      <p>Hello! My name is Erik. I really don't like to talk about myself, but I suppose this is the place to do it. I'm changing every day, so I will be a different person by the time you read this versus when I wrote this. I guess I can get into what I've been into lately and what I've been into my whole life.</p>

      <p>I've always loved music and Star Wars. Lately, I feel like I haven't been playing as much music I should be but I know I will come back to it so that's not a big deal. I think it's important to have creative outlets in life, and music is definitely one of the best ones. I used to like to socialize a lot more, but these days I find myself enjoying quiet time, staying in, and I've become more selective about which social engagements I'm interested in.</p>

      <p>My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and launch a fulfilling career. I feel like challenging your brain is important to growth, and programming surely does that. There's always something to learn and it's always changing. Also, a lot of people don't realize how much creativity can go into programming. You can create whatever you want!</p>
